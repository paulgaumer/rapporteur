# Rapporteur - Firefox add-on (discontinued)

Rapporteur is an adaptation for Firefox of the Chrome Linkedin Sales Navigator add-on (ex-Rapportive).
It injects information from Linkedin about your correspondents straight into your Gmail interface.

Its usage has been discontinued due to Linkedin cutting the access to the unofficial API it was based on (Sept 2020).

However the code remains valid and could be useful for similar projects.
